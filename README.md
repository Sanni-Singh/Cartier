## Mentor

We were guided by **SWARAJ ANAND**, who provided invaluable feedback, code reviews, and advice on responsive design and web development best practices. The mentor's involvement helped us follow industry standards and improve our technical skills.

Once the project is opened in a browser, you can navigate through various pages of the website, view product listings, and experience a fully responsive design. Resize your browser or open the website on different devices to test the responsive behavior.

## Responsive Design

The website was developed with a mobile-first approach and features responsive breakpoints for: 
- Mobile devices: 320px - 767px
- Tablets: 768px - 1023px

The layout adapts seamlessly across these devices to maintain optimal user experience.
